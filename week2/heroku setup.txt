Heroku setup (steps as of 1/30/16)

Go to the folder you want to host.

Make sure that you have the following files in your folder:

composer.json that only has this inside of it:

{}
index.php that only has this inside of it (please remove the angle brackets inside the quotes)

<?php include_once("<filename of your html file with the extension>"); ?>
Make sure you push up everything to your github repository. Make sure the only files you are pushing up are the html, css, images, composer.json and index.php files. No extra files!
