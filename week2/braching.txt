 Make a repo

push an index.html file to it

put an h1 of your favorite band

put an image of your favorite band

push it to github

push to heroku

git checkout -b another-band * is short for making a new branch and immediately switching to it

git branch * tells you all the branches you have locally and the one that you are currently on

modify the h1 to be the new band name

add a picture of that new band in the html file

git push origin another-band

make a pull request to master with the branch you made

github will say can not merge due to merge conflicts

go to terminal and do git pull origin master

get out of vim

git push origin another-band

then go back to github.com to see the pull request - now you can merge it in - go ahead merge it
